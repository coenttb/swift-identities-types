    /// A namespace for server-side identity management operations and authentication services.
    ///
    /// The `Provider` namespace provides types and interfaces for identity provider services
    /// to implement authentication and identity management, including:
    /// - Authentication verification and token issuance
    /// - Identity lifecycle management (creation, deletion)
    /// - Security operations (password validation, token management)
    /// - Email verification and communication
    ///
    /// The namespace is designed to work in tandem with the `Consumer` namespace,
    /// sharing common types through `Identity_Shared` to ensure consistent and secure
    /// client-server interactions. Key features include:
    /// - Secure token generation and validation
    /// - User credential management
    /// - Multi-factor authentication support
    /// - Session management and monitoring
    ///
    /// The provider acts as the authoritative source for identity verification and
    /// can serve multiple consumer applications while maintaining centralized
    /// security controls and user management.
